        <h2>Hamas counterproposal on hostage and ceasefire deal calls for phased Israeli pullout from Gaza and plan to
          end war</h2>
        <p>Hamas has presented its response to a proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza by calling for a
          phased Israeli withdrawal from the enclave during a four-and-a-half-month truce and a plan to permanently end
          the war, according to a copy of the group’s counteroffer obtained by CNN.

          The Palestinian militant group that rules Gaza has proposed a three-phase deal, each lasting 45 days, that
          would also see the gradual release of hostages held in the enclave in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in
          Israel – including those serving life sentences – as well as the start of a massive humanitarian and
          rebuilding effort.

          Contrary to earlier demands, Hamas did not call for an immediate end to the war. Negotiations for a permanent
          ceasefire would take place during the truce and the remaining hostages would only be released once a final
          deal to end the war was agreed, the document said.</p>
        <p>The proposal was a response to a framework agreement presented by negotiators in Paris at the end of last
          month. Senior Hamas official Muhammad Nazzal confirmed the text seen by CNN was genuine.</p>

        <h2>Ukraine says it sank Russian warship off coast of Crimea and unleashed ‘massive’ missile barrage on
          peninsula</h2>
        <p>
          Ukraine’s military intelligence says it sank a Russian warship off the coast of Crimea overnight into
          Thursday, landing the latest in a series of blows to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet after mounting a “massive”
          missile attack on the occupied peninsula hours earlier.

          Russia’s guided missile ship, the “Ivanovets,” suffered multiple hits to its hull before it sank overnight in
          the harbor of Lake Donuzlav, Crimea’s deepest lake, Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence said.

          Night-time footage supplied by Ukraine showed naval drones racing toward the Russian ship before exploding on
          impact, causing significant damage to the vessel. At the end of the video, the ship appears to have sunk, with
          just its bow above water. CNN could not independently verify Ukraine’s claims and it is unclear from the
          footage which vessel was struck and when.</p>

        <h2>Millions of Palestinians are trapped in Rafah. As Israeli troops approach, there’s nowhere left to run</h2>
        <p>Displaced Palestinians crowded into tents in Rafah are waiting with dread for an anticipated Israeli ground
          assault on the city – with nowhere left to flee once troops move in.

          One million people are estimated to be crammed into a tent city in the southern Gaza location, with satellite
          images showing that the makeshift shelter is rapidly expanding.

          Others are packed into houses in the city, where rocket attacks are already commonplace.

          “We hear (drones) very, very loud, and we hear the sounds of bombing at night,” Kareem Dahman, a displaced
          Palestinian in the city, told CNN. The most recent bombing was “very close” to where Dahman lives, with more
          than a dozen family members in a single room of a friend’s house, he said.

          He said conditions in Rafah are “very difficult,” describing a “large number of people, chaos, and high
          prices.”</p>

        <h2>Senegal was Africa’s poster child for democracy. Where did it all go wrong?</h2>
        <p>
          In a region plagued by volatility, Senegal had long been praised for its political stability.

          But the West African country now finds itself at a dangerous crossroads with tensions escalating after its
          outgoing President Macky Sall postponed the upcoming general election just three weeks ahead of its scheduled
          date.

          News of the election delay, which came as official campaigning for the February 25 vote was due to start,
          sparked widespread anger in the country with angry youths burning tires in the streets in protest.

          Sall, whose second and final term runs out in April, announced Saturday that the vote would not be held as
          planned, citing disputes over a final list of presidential candidates that excluded dozens of opposition
          aspirants.

          That has angered opponents, who see the move as a bid by Sall to extend his tenure and raised fears of a
          repeat of the deadly protests last year that were sparked by rumors he intended to run again for office.

          Experts say the latest unexpected turn of events has not only put in doubt Senegal’s role as a regional
          anchor, but also raises concerns about the potential ripple effects in other parts of West Africa, which has
          seen numerous military takeovers in recent years.</p>
